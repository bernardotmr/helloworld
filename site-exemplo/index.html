    <p>[Intro]
My phone full
I know she ain't loyal, but she make me better, ayy
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
I know she ain't, yo, ayy
Ayy, yo, yo, ayy
Ayy, I know she ain’t, woah, ayy

[Verse]
Ayy, I want VVS' more than ever, ayy
Accept she for the streets, it's for the better, ayy
I know she ain't loyal, but she make me better, ayy
Five thousand at Crazy Girls or better
My bitch finessed a nigga because I let her, ayy
Ten thousand at Crazy Girls or better
I've been there before, it's nothing special
I've seen this before, it's something special
Recoup that advance like give me better
Treat it like a jet, not a sports car
Treat her like a dog or a sports car
Dashboard, big screen like a sports bar
I know she ain't loyal, but she make me better
Why I seen you staring with the devil?
I know she ain't loyal, but she make me better
She know she ain’t shit, but it make her jealous
I do what I do, and it make them jealous
I be off them Percs, you know my schedule
Yeah yeah, yeah
Treat it like a, not a sports car
Treat her like a dog or a sports car
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, ayy
I want VVS' for the better, ayy, I want, ayy
I want VVS' more than ever
I want VVS' for the better, ayy</p>
